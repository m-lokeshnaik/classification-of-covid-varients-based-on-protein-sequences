To develop machine learning models like CatBoost, TabNet, and RandomForest for these datasets, follow these steps:

Step-by-Step Process for Model Development
1. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values.
Combine the datasets if necessary.
Encode categorical variables (class labels).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
2. Feature Engineering
Scale the features if required.
Perform any additional feature transformations if necessary.
3. Model Training
Train models using CatBoost, TabNet, and RandomForest.
Tune hyperparameters for each model.
4. Model Evaluation
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
Compare the models to select the best one.
5. Model Deployment (Optional)
Save the best model for future predictions.
